### Details
This is a basic README generator, made to create a templated README from terminal input. The results are nothing fancy, but should be functional, should one decide to create a README file by entering all the text content into a command line.
Most of the input the generator takes is placed in the corresponding places in the README. However, it also uses the GitHub API to look up the user's GitHub account, and provide appropriate avatar, email, and badge info. The badge info is presently dependent on the repo name, as well.
There's not currently any functionality that keeps the user from entering an entirely inaccurate name or repo. However, this will only serve to nullify the contact information auto-fill and badge details.
