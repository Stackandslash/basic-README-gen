## Installation
You should download this, then put it on a floppy disk, then carefully measure the sides of the floppy disk, before discarding it and opening the HTML file in your browser.

## Usage
Search for your city of choice, and see the weather forecast appear!

## License
I don't have a license.

## Contributing
Written by me, designed by my instructors, made possible with weathermap API.

## Tests
Try searching your own town! Then search New York, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and see them fill in your past searches. Then try to search Explosiontown, and see how it rejects that option. Then click your past searches to see them come up all over again. And then try entering them manually again, and see them arrive without making extra entries. TADA!
